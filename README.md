Deezer-Preview is a react web application currently under development that allows users to search for songs within the Deezer API. The users can play a 30 second preview of the songs available through Deezer.
Users can control playback, repeat songs and playlists, shuffle songs and show extended view of the current song.
The web application is under development and is far from finished, but you can preview the project [here](https://deezer-preview.netlify.app) as it continues to get developed. Test it on your mobile for the best experience.
