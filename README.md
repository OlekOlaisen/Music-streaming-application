Deezer-Preview is a react web application currently under development that allows users to search for songs within the Deezer API. The users can play a 30 second preview of the songs available through Deezer. 
The web application is under development and is far from finished, but you can preview the project [here](https://deezer-preview.netlify.app/) as it continues to get developed.

NOTE: The web application is mobile first, and is not responsive to desktop yet. (This will come soon)

The application has the following features:
```
- Home, Search, Playlists pages

 ## Technologies Used

## Minimum Viable Product (MVP)
